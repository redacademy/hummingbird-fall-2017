# Hummingbird Network 

A WordPress site designed and created for Hummingbird Network, an organization dedicated to the early warning of forest fires in western Canada. This site is intended to spread awareness and encourage potential volunteers to sign up and enhance their ability to have universal, immediate indication of forest fires throughout the western provinces. We have created a simple to use, attractive website used to spread awareness and encourage potential volunteers to sign up.

This project is part of Red Academy coursework.
